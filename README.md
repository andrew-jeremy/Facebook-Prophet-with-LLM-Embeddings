# Facebook-Prophet-with-LLM-Embeddings
The script will train a hybrid time series model with Prophet for time series data and a pre-trained BERT model for categorical embeddings.

# Prophet-PyTorch Flight Delay Prediction
Notes
The project uses Prophet for time series forecasting and PyTorch for neural networks.
Pre-trained BERT embeddings are used to process categorical features like airline, origin, and destination.
Predictions are made for flight delays using both time series and categorical data.
Requirements
The project requires the following libraries:

torch
transformers
prophet
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
plotly
All required libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file.


This repository contains a hybrid time series forecasting model that combines Facebook Prophet and PyTorch for predicting flight delays using both time series data and categorical embeddings generated by a pre-trained language model (BERT).
